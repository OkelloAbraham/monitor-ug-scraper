Photo by Moses Okeya ","author":"By Moses Okeya","story":"Jinja Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Mr Eric Sakwa, has directed police to shoot dead whoever is caught red-handed killing boda boda riders.Mr Sakwa gave the bizarre directive on Sunday after a 28-year-old boda boda rider was killed and robbed of his motorcycle on Saturday. Sadat Mulyowa Wandera, a resident of Kitove Village, Mafubira  Sub-county in Jinja District, was beaten to death by hammer-welding passengers who later fled with his motorcycle registration number UES 499G.“We are tired of thieves stealing and killing boda boda cyclists. Whoever is caught (in the act) should be shot dead. We shall perform an autopsy after we have killed them,\" Mr Sakwa, who heads security in the district, said in a telephone interview.The Chairperson of Jinja Boda Boda operators, Mr Eria Musobya, said the deceased was murdered by the criminals who pretended to be passengers heading to Magwa.\"They turned against him and murdered him near YMCA Hostel. This crime has shocked the boda boda fraternity in Jinja who thought such murders were only happening elsewhere,\" Mr Musobya said.The Chairperson Bata Boda Boda Stage in Jinja Town, Mr Ibrahim Kiwanuka, asked government to install CCTV cameras in Jinja Town like they have done in Kampala. This, he said, will capture faces of those who steal their motorcycles.“Motorcycle thieves are running to Jinja because Kampala is fitted with CCTV cameras. We also ask government to install cameras in this town, not to only help the boda bodas, but also curb other criminal activities,\" Mr Kiwanuka said.He said that once such thieves are arrested, they should be killed, warning that once taken into police custody, they would be given bond and begin from where they stopped.The boda boda industry has recently been rocked by a spate of murders, notably that of Derrick Mulindwa in Rubaga, a Kampala suburb, which was captured on CCTV and the video went viral.Mr Sakwa also asked boda boda riders to always furnish security operatives with information because some of them know these groups, where they sleep and to whom they sell the stolen motorcycles.Following Mr Wandera's death, fellow riders rode his body through the streets of Jinja Town while demonstrating the manner in which their colleague was killed.Efforts to get a comment from the Regional Police Commander, Mr Paul Nkore, were futile as he didn't answer or return our calls by press time. He was however quoted by another media outlet as saying investigations are underway.","_id":"e3Axhx8qXbxFnwEk"}

FILE PHOTO  ","author":"By Clare Muhindo","story":"Minister of State for Privatisation and Investment,Ms Evelyn Anite has said there is a plan by mafias in government to kill her.Addressing the press Monday morning at Ministry of Finance headquarters in Kampala, Ms Anite said that there was a plan to remove her from the Uganda Telecom (UTL) battle and to end her life.  “The plan by the mafias is to take Anite out of the picture, I might die but history will judge them. You know the mafias, they are the ones who have been blocking the audit,” she said.She, however, said that she would not stop fighting to save UTL or exposing bad characters in government.“These mafias are not jokers. Go and ask Abiriga. I will die with my mouth open, I will die while shouting the mafias are coming, until they take me down. They are tapping my phone, I hear their voices when I pick up my phone.”Last week, a whistle blower petitioned the IGG asking for investigations into an alleged secret booking from US via France to Mauritius by Ms Anite to meet investors who want to take over UTL.But Ms Anite denied having any relationship with the Mauritius Company and said the petition was the work of the mafias.She also said that she has never been to Mauritius as alleged by the petition.“I have no relationship with Mauritius Telecom Company. The report by financial intelligence is what prompted me to support them. My name has been tarnished but I will continue fighting for the truth,” she said.  Two weeks back High Court in Kampala ordered for an audit into the struggling Uganda Telecom (UTL) within 30 days as the minister had requested.“My issue is that the telecom has to be saved, whether Abimanya is in or out. I have struggled to save that company three times, the first time we argued with attorney generals, they said we must liquidate it. Private lawyers argued the case against liquidation, and we won.”The audit into UTL started last Thursday.READ: High Court orders audit into struggling UTLEarlier on August 2, Mr Keith Muhakanizi, the secretary to the treasury had issued a letter directing the UTL administrator, Mr Twebaze Bemanya, not to avail the books of accounts to the ministry’s internal auditor general, Mr Fixon Okony.Ms Anite had also in her letter of July 24, given an ultimatum of one month to Mr Okony to audit UTL as ordered by the President.UTL was put under administration in May 2017 after Libyans, who owned 69% of the shares, left at a time when the company had a Shs700b debt.In January, government kicked out Nigerian firm Teleology Holdings Ltd after it failed to pay Shs268 billion within three months of being awarded the UTL deal as had been agreed by both parties.The core purpose of reviewing a company is to among others; identify inefficiencies, reduce costs and achieve organisational objectives.Similarly, auditing firms may investigate potential theft or fraud and ensure compliance with applicable regulations and policies.","_id":"ziYAlQpoW1NjssYD"}

The police officers on the ground had to calm them down.Total E&P Uganda officials immediately left the football pitch as spectators continued arguing over the decision taken by the leaders.Total E&P Uganda Public Relations Coordinator Christopher Ocowun described the clashes as unfortunate adding that the Nwoya leaders’ reaction was uncalled for, given the fact the match was already ongoing.\"We have taken note of the concern raised by the LC5 Chairman and plan to meet them as soon as possible to resolve the difference amicably,\" Mr Ocowun said.He added: \"We have been working together for four years and would love to continue working jointly to promote talent development in Nwoya as part of our corporate social responsibility.\" One of the spectators Mr Denis Okwerajok, 48, a resident of Wi Anono lauded the leaders for fighting for them, however he said they should have waited for the match to end.“His action as a leader was childish and too political because as a leader you should show people the best way of handling differences; he chose rude means which depicts bad leadership from Nwoya District in the eyes of investors organising the football tournament,” Mr Okwerajok said, adding, “I only pray Total comes back after agreeing with the leaders because from the look on their faces, they were annoyed and I’m scared they may cancel the tournament then the youth lose,” he added.However James Oloya another spectator said the decision taken by chairperson was right.“We have many public address systems, tents and business persons who can supply mineral water and offer services to the expectation of Total,” Mr Oloya said.Mr Godfrey Obalim, the Lisborn FC coach said the political leaders want to use the mini league for political gain.\"The halting of this match is politically motivated because in the past three editions we have been competing in this league without any problem and with support of these leaders. How is it possible that the district sports officer okayed it, along with other leaders and the chairman is against it?\" he asked.The 4th Edition of Mini League was organised by Total E&P Uganda in a bid to foster interaction with the communities while promoting and strengthening relations with the different stakeholders within Tilenga project areas, besides promoting local talent and development of the youth.","_id":"6aS4ADRzEDX9pm43"}

Uganda has, according to BoU been","caption":"\nChallenges. Uganda has, according to BoU been experiencing some good growth but internal and external risks are likely to present some challenges. PHOTO BY EDGAR R BATTE  ","author":"By MARTIN LUTHER OKETCH ","story":"The Central Bank has warned that a number of risks both internal and external are likely to dampen the economy in the next two to five years. Speaking at the presentation of the Monetary Policy statement in Kampala yesterday, Mr Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile, the Bank of Uganda governor, said external risks such as depressed global economic growth were likely to affect tourism receipts thus worsening an already tilted balance of payments. This, he said, could be exacerbated by domestic risks resulting from weather-related constraints to agricultural production and delays in the implementation of public investment programmes. However, Mr Mutebile maintained, the economic growth will in the medium term remain robust, growing at about 6.2 per cent. “There are downward side risks to this outlook. On the external scene, lower external demand due to depressed global economy could weigh on our balance of payments, particularly in the tourism sector and lead to volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market,” Mr Mutebile said, but noted the projected risks were still manageable. Global economies including UK and US have already reported signs of sliding into recession, which could be disastrous for particularly Uganda that has in the last 10 years seen increased dependency on foreign direct investment and remittances. Bank of Uganda also maintained the Central Bank Rate at 10 per cent with Mr Mutebile noting that the monetary policy stance had helped to keep inflation below the Central Bank target of below 5 per cent. However, the Central Bank noted that inflation is projected to edge up slightly and peak at 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 due in part to stronger domestic demand conditions. Food crops prices, which highly contribute to inflationary pressures, and the path of the exchange rate, have remained volatile, thus presenting risks to the current stability. Uganda, according to Dr Adam Mugume, the Bank of Uganda executive director in charge of research, has already seen a decline of 9 per cent in export receipts resulting into a drop in coffee, beans and maize exports. However, he noted, the country received the highest volume of foreign direct investment for the 2018/19 financial year. $1.8b was registered in the period. Much of Uganda’s foreign direct investment, according Bank of Uganda data, comes from Europe, US, China and India. Uganda receives a fairly higher remittance share but inflows, Dr Mugume said, have remained flat at $1.2b for the past two years. Improved performanceDr Adam Mugume, the Bank of Uganda executive director in charge of research also noted that the shilling continues to gain against the dollar, registering a lower depreciation rate of 0.5 per cent against the dollar by June 2019. The shilling yesterday closed at Shs3,689.71 (buying) and Shs3,699.71 (selling). ","_id":"ji98MIN4BD2n0pHT"}

The company is accused of failure to pay for metal works on its construction site on Namirembe Road in Kampala.In summons issued by court, Guangdong Hao He Engineering and Construction has 15 days within which it must file a defence failure of which court will enter judgment with its defence. According to documents before court, V. Kanga Mental Works claims installed mild steel doors and handrail works, among others but Guangdong Hao He Engineering and Construction had refused or ignored to pay for the service. In the case filed through Enoth Mugabi Advocates and Solicitors, V Kanga Mental Works claims that sometime in 2017, Guangdong Hao He Engineering and Construction, which had been contracted to construct retail blocks at the New Taxi Park on Mackay Road and Namirembe Road, sub-contracted V Kanga Mental Works to supply mental works valued at Shs1.4 billion.However, upon completion of the works, Guangdong Hao He Engineering and Construction only made a part payment of the contractual sum, leaving a balance of Shs493m.V Kanga Mental Works, court documents indicate, executed all works to agreed standards but the balance of the payment has not been executed despite several reminders and demand notices regarding the same. The refusal to pay, V Kanga Mental Works claims, has financially constrained the operations of the company and a notice of intention to sue was ignored. Therefore, V Kanga Mental Works is seeking a court declaration and order for the payment of the balance due, payment of damages for breach of contract, interest at commercial rate and costs to the suit.

FILE PHOTO  ","author":"By ABDUL-NASSER SSEMUGABI & MARTIN LUTHER OKETCH ","story":" Cipla Quality Chemicals yesterday appointed Grant Thornton Uganda to replace Ernst & Young as the company’s new auditors. The appointment was confirmed by shareholders during the company’s annual general meeting in Luzira, Kampala. Thornton’s contract will be reviewed at the end of Cipla’s current financial year in March 2020. The directors agreed that external auditors be rotated to ensure independence. Mr Emmanuel Katongole, the Cipla Quality Chemicals executive director, during the meeting noted that Ernst & Young had done a commendable job, saying if it wasn’t for his fellow directors’ decision, he would have wanted the company to continue. In the meeting, Cipla also told its shareholders that the company’s revenue reduced significantly because Global Fund, their biggest client for malarial and antiretroviral drugs, resorted to preventive measures and cut its consumption from $25m (Shs92.3b) to just $2.5m (Shs9b) in the previous financial year. However, Cipla chief executive officer Nevin Bradford, assured the shareholders of a better year because in 2019, Global Fund had already made orders worth $8m (Shs29.2m). In results published in March, Cipla reported a substantial fall in profits to Shs6.8b for the year ended March 30, 2018 from Shs44.6b. The drug maker, however, informed shareholders yesterday that the company would reinvest all the profits, which means that there will be no dividends for 2018. Mr Nevien said the company had so far invested Shs12b in buying raw materials, noting that they are seeking to increase product portfolio through new medicines for the treatment of marginalised diseases such as malaria, HIV Aids and hepatitis. The company also told shareholders that plans to register in 22 countries across Africa by 2020 were in advanced stages, adding that they had completed a Shs12b expansion plan to establish a 4,500 pallet storage facility, distribution centre and warehouse. According to the March results operational costs increased by Shs7.9b due to aggressive marketing and sales costs related to the September, 2018 initial public offering. Mr Katongole told shareholders that as a company newly listed on USE they would seek more avenues through which they would create regular and constructive dialogue with shareholders to align their interest with the business objectives. Rough startShare price: Cipla has had a rough start on the Uganda Securities Exchange with the company’s stock price falling to Shs145 from Shs256.5 during the initial public offering in September. In the meeting, shareholders demanded that the company devises ways through which it can cut down on costs as well as adopting an aggressive marketing strategy in the local drugs market.
